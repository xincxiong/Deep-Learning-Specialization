**This repo includes all programming assignments from deeplearning specilization supported by Andrew Ng on Coursera. I have completed these five courses and get the certificate on Feb, 2018**.

1. **Neural Networks and Deep Learning**
   - Understand the major technology trends driving Deep Learning
   - Be able to build, train and apply fully connected deep neural networks 
   - Know how to implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks 
   - Understand the key parameters in a neural network's architecture 
   
2. **Improving Deep Neural Networks Hyperparameter**
   - Understand industry best-practices for building deep learning applications. 
   - Be able to effectively use the common neural network "tricks", including initialization, L2 and dropout regularization, Batch     normalization, gradient checking, 
   - Be able to implement and apply a variety of optimization algorithms, such as mini-batch gradient descent, Momentum, RMSprop and Adam, and check for their convergence. 
   - Understand new best-practices for the deep learning era of how to set up train/dev/test sets and analyze bias/variance
   - Be able to implement a neural network in TensorFlow and Keras.
   
   
3. **Structuring Machine Learning Projects**

   - Understand how to diagnose errors in a machine learning system, and 
   - Be able to prioritize the most promising directions for reducing error
   - Understand complex ML settings, such as mismatched training/test sets, and comparing to and/or surpassing human-level performance
   - Know how to apply end-to-end learning, transfer learning, and multi-task learning
   
4. **Convolutional Neural Networks**
   - Understand how to build a convolutional neural network, including recent variations such as residual networks.
   - Know how to apply convolutional networks to visual detection and recognition tasks.
   - Know to use neural style transfer to generate art.
   - Be able to apply these algorithms to a variety of image, video, and other 2D or 3D data.

5. **Sequence Models**
   - Understand how to build and train Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and commonly-used variants such as GRUs and LSTMs.
   - Be able to apply sequence models to natural language problems, including text synthesis. 
   - Be able to apply sequence models to audio applications, including speech recognition and music synthesis.

This specialization includes the foundations of Deep Learning understand how to build neural network, and learn how to lead successful machine learning projects. I have learn about Convolutional Networks,RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more. I have worked on case studies from healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading, music generation, and natural language processing. I mastered not only the theory, but also see how it is applied in industry. I practiced all these ideas in Python and in TensorFlow and Keras.
